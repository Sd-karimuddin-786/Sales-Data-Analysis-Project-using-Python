**Sales Data Analysis Project using Python**

This project is based on Sales Data Analysis, which I developed using Python as part of my learning journey. This project is designed to explore, analyze, and visualize sales data to gain meaningful insights such as identifying top-selling products and trends in sales over time, in this project I used some Business Questions to Analyze the data.

**Steps Involved in this Project:**

**Imported Libraries:** In this project I used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.         
**Imported Dataset:**  In this project I used Sales Dataset it is in CSV file.                         
**Data Cleaning:**  In data cleaning process I uses some methods like finding Null Values, Dropping Null Values, filling null values, replaced null values, renamed some columns and deleted some duplicated values.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**                                                                     
I did Data Analysis based on few Business Questions and extracted valuable insights:                   
 **Few Questions & Answers:**

**Data Visualization:** I did Data Visualization based on few Business Questions and extracted valuable insights, and I Used few Charts & Graphs:
